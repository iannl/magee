        <h1 class="type">Cobble’s Corner is home to Cobble’s Knot, which had never been untied until Maniac came along. Maniac got free pizza from untying Cobble’s Knot, however he had a pizza allergy, so he gave his pizza to Russel and Piper, to 	bribe them to go to school. But after a while Russel and Piper stopped excepting the pizza.</h1>
