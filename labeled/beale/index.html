        <h1 class="type">Maniac Magee’s ‘First Stop’ is the Beale’s house. He lived with Amanda, Hester and Lester. Maniac fits in as if he belongs at the Beale’s house and has always been there. Sadly, Maniac leaves because the house got vandalized, so he does not stay there forever. At the end of the book Amanda calls Maniac back to her family, and Maniac finally has a home.</h1>
