        <h1 class="type">Hector street is the street the separates the blacks from the whites. Maniac Magee runs out of town down the centre of Hector Street. John McNab and the Cobras stop at Hector Street because it is the barrier that separates the white side of town from the black side of town. John McNab and his prejudiced friends are white and believe that Maniac Magee will never make it out alive in the East End, and so do not go past Hector Street.</h1>
